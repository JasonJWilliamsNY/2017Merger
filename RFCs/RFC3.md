# RFC3: Membership Council

## Current vision for the Membership Council:
* Composition: The current Software Carpentry (SWC) Advisory Council will be transitioned to a Membership Council for 
The Carpentries. This Membership Council will be composed similarily to the current 
[SWC Advisory Council](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/advisory-council.md), with each member 
organization assigning a point of contact to serve on the Council. 
* Responsibilities: The Membership Council will serve as a method with which to communicate with institutional 
members about changes in policy related to financial stakeholders, as well as a mechanism for organizational members 
to raise issues with both staff and The Carpentries Board of Directors. The Membership Council will ideally be developed 
into a stronger group of advocates for The Carpentries through regular meetings and information sharing.
* Medium to long-term plan: Create a separate Advisory Council (8-10 individuals) of non-Board members who can provide 
outside insight into strategic planning.

## For discussion:
