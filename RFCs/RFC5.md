# RFC5: Finances

STATUS: Open until October 6, 2017

## Current vision for The Carpentries finances:
* Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are currently separate financial entities with independent budgets, 
both sheltered by our fiscal sponsor NumFOCUS. 
* Most income for both organizations is derived from organizational membership agreements (e.g., contracts signed 
with institutions as silver/gold/platinum memberships), grants, and workshop fees. The vast majority of organizational 
memberships are joint between SWC and DC, so institutional members are not likely to experience substantially different 
interactions with The Carpentries than with SWC and DC as they currently exist. 
* The Carpentries will operate under a unified budget initially sheltered under NumFOCUS.

## For discussion:

* Q1: Do you have any questions about The Carpentries financial status?
