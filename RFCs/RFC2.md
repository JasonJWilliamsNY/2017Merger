# RFC2: Board of Directors

**Previous motions, approved by the Software Carpentry (SWC) Steering Committee and Data Carpentry (DC) Board:**

* *The Board of Directors for the combined organization [The Carpentries] will be composed of 9 members, each serving 
a two year term without limits on the number of terms. Five members of the board will be appointed through a process 
of nomination (with community input) to the board followed by voting by remaining board members. The other four members 
will be elected by the membership of the organization. 
(Approved [July 3](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/minutes/minutes-2017-07-03.md))*
* *Appointed members: The first set of appointees come from current members of DC’s Board (Ethan White and Karen Cranston) 
and SWC’s (elected) Steering Committee (Mateusz Kuzak, Sue McClatchy, Kate Hertweck). These individuals were chosen to 
represent our current leadership perspectives from multiple viewpoints (geography, technical expertise, experience with 
the Carpentries). These first appointments have been approved by the motion of DC Board and SWC Steering Committee on 
31st of August.*

**Current vision for The Carpentries Board of Directors:**
* Responsibilities: We anticipate that role of the Board is governance / steering rather than execution / operations. 
All members will share equally in the financial and legal responsibilities associated with Board service. Specific tasks 
include:
  * Setting short, medium, and long term goals for The Carpentries
  * Ensuring obligations to both institutional members and lesson organizations are met
  * Providing continual feedback relating to performance evaluation for the Executive Director 
* Composition: Appointed members ensure that the Board has the expertise required for strategic goals, while elected 
members continue the democratic traditions of the Software Carpentry Foundation and allow interested community members 
to be part of the leadership. Yearly elections for 2 new members (four total elected members on the Board), election 
procedures will be adapted from SWC’s current processes (https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/governance.md)
Membership guidelines (who can vote and run in election) includes active instructors or other contributing community 
members (as tracked in AMY)

**For Discussion:**
* Q1: Do you agree with above described responsibilities of the Board of Directors of The Carpentries organisation? 
Specifically:
  * Q1a: Are there any responsibilities missing?
  * Q1b: Is there anything for which the Board should not be responsible?
