# RFC6: Subcommittees and task forces

**Previous motion, approved by the Software Carpentry (SWC) Steering Committee and Data Carpentry (DC) Board:** 
*Existing subcommittees and task forces will have a point of contact from among The Carpentries staff, rather than 
reporting directly to the Board of Directors.* 

**Current vision:**
* Reporting: The subcommittees perform important work of the organization. They currently report directly to the 
SWC Steering Committee, which is inconsistent with a Board responsible for governance, not operations. The subcommittees 
should instead work directly with staff, overseen by the Executive Director.
* Governance: SWC has an existing method through which new subcommittees (and task forces) 
[may be approved](https://github.com/swcarpentry/board/blob/master/subcommittees/proposal_instructions.md), which can 
be adapted to suit The Carpentries. Once approved by The Carpentries Board of Directors, each subcommittee is responsible 
for determining their own method of governance (e.g., who is a member, meeting schedule) to best meet their needs, although 
a point of contact (usually chair of the subcommittee) is required for reporting purposes.
* Existing (active) subcommittees and task forces (all planned to continue): 
  * Instructor trainers: conducting instructor training, maintaining lesson repo (movement to Carpentries organization 
  approved by SWC Steering Committee)
  * Policy: enforcing Code of Conduct
  * CarpentryCon task force: planning and implementing (yearly?) convention for community
  * Mentoring: resource for instructors and connected with instructor training
  * Infrastructure: maintaining consistent and stable templating for lessons

**For discussion:**
* Q1: Do you have any comments or suggestions on the organisation of Subcommittees and Task Forces under the umbrella of 
The Carpentries organisation? Specifically:
  * Q1a: on reporting?
	* Q1b: governance?
* Q2:  Are there any new subcommittees that would be beneficial?
