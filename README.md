# 2017 Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Merger

Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are currently independent organizations 
with their own fiscal sponsorship, governance model, and bank 
accounts. However, as is perhaps no surprise that the organizations' operations have 
evolved to share memberships, infrastructure for workshop coordination, an instructor 
training program, and even some staff members. You can learn about the history of the two 
organisations and reasons for the merger in [this blog post](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html).

The Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Steering Committees (SC) met jointly and 
approved two motions on August 30, 2017, which together form a strong commitment to 
an eventual transition to a single umbrella organization (provisionally titled 
“The Carpentries”) to oversee shared responsibilities, with Software Carpentry and 
Data Carpentry continuing as Lesson Organizations overseeing their respective workshop 
and lesson curriculum.


## Community Involvement
We would like to get input from the community about roles, structure and responsibilities 
planned for the new organisation. In order to facilitate this discussion, leaders from 
both groups have written a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs). RFCs are a mechanism 
([traditionally used for development of internet standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)) 
through which leaders can gain a better understanding of community opinions on policies 
and activities that have yet to be implemented. Each RFC contains proposed ideas for the 
combined organization, with a few questions to solicit feedback. After October 6, 2017, 
the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Steering Committees  
will review the community’s ideas and incorporate them into future decisions about the 
merger.  

There will be more ways to contribute to the merger conversation after these requests for 
comment!  We will need volunteers to help review bylaws, contribute to Lesson Organization 
discussions, and run for the elected positions on The Carpentries Board. The Software 
Carpentry and Data Carpentry blogs and this repository will all be places to hear the 
latest news about what’s happening with the merger and how you can be involved.
