# 2017 Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Merger

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are currently independent organizations with their own fiscal sponsorship, Steering Committees, governance model, and bank accounts. However, as is perhaps no surprise that the organizations' operations have evolved to share memberships, infrastructure for workshop coordination, an instructor training program, and even some staff members. 

On August 30, 2017, the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Steering Committees met jointly and approved two motions, which together form a strong commitment to continue moving forward with the merger, and to eventually hand off governance to a joint Carpentries Steering Committee
