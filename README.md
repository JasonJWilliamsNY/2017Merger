# 2017 Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Merger

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are currently independent organizations with their own fiscal sponsorship, Steering Committees, governance model, and bank accounts. However, as is perhaps no surprise that the organizations' operations have evolved to share memberships, infrastructure for workshop coordination, an instructor training program, and even some staff members. 

The Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Steering Committees met jointly and approved two motions on August 30, 2017, which together form a strong commitment to continue moving forward with the merger, and to eventually hand off governance to a joint Carpentries Steering Committee

## January 1, 2018
This is our target date for merging. Until then, the two organizations will continue operating as independent organtizations.
