**For Discussion:**
* Role: Staff are employed to interact with and serve The Carpentries community, including a wide variety of stakeholders 
like instructors, learners, and institutional members.
* Executive Director (ED) The ED is the link between the Board and the operations of the organization. The ED will have 
autonomy to make decisions about running the organization, given strategic direction from the Board. Recommendations for 
responsibilities include:
  * Ensure fulfillment of all negotiated contracts with membership organizations, including maintaining appropriate 
  financial management
  * Implementing strategic planning (as directed by the Board) through both staff and community involvement
  * Bringing policy and strategic planning ideas to the Board
  * Allocating staff time in a fair and equitable manner to promote general Carpentries activities as well as targeted 
  goals of lesson organizations
  * Ensuring human resources requirements for all staff are met, including regular performance evaluations, professional 
  development opportunities, and hiring additional staff.
* Director of Business Development: Business development is critical to the long-term sustainability of the organization. 
This Director will manage all new contract negotiations and renewals with existing member organizations, and will report 
to the ED.
* Other staff: All other current staff will be invited to transition to employees of The Carpentries 
(note: Maneesha, Erin, and Belinda already share responsibility with for both SWC and DC). Specific responsibilities will 
be determined by the ED, and will include having at least one staff person assigned as point of contact for each of the 
subcommittees (see the [RFC on subcommittees]()).
* Recommendations for organizational structure and staff roles:
  * Major responsibilities currently overseen by staff include:
  * Negotiating organizational memberships
  * Instructor training
  * Assessment
  * Workshop coordination
  * Community engagement/management
* Additional responsibilities to consider for additional staff hires or staff reorganization.  Some of these are 
“unofficial” duties for current SWC or DC staff; others are done by volunteers from the community.
  * Personnel operations (hiring, performance evaluations, professional development)
  * Technical operations (managing website, sysadmin for servers)
  * Lesson operations (lesson templating, lesson release)

* Q1: Do you have any comments or suggestions on the role of staff in the context of Carpentries umbrella organisation?
* Q2: What do you see as the most urgent staffing priorities for the combined Carpentries organization?
