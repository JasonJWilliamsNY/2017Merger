# RFC5: Finances

**Current vision:**
* Software Carpentry (SWC) and Data Carpentry (DC) are currently separate financial entities with independent budgets, 
both sheltered by our fiscal sponsor NumFOCUS. 
* Most income for both organizations is derived from organizational membership agreements (e.g., contracts signed 
with institutions as silver/platinum memberships), grants, and workshop fees. The vast majority of organizational 
memberships are joint between SWC and DC, so institutional members are not likely to experience substantially different 
interactions with The Carpentries than with SWC and DC as they currently exist. 
* The Carpentries would operate under a unified budget initially sheltered under NumFOCUS, but will initiate planning 
for emergence as an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organization registered in the USA.

**For discussion:**
* Q1: Do you have any questions about The Carpentries financial status?
